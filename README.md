<h1>On-screen Calculator using JavaScript/HTML/CSS</h1>

<p>The goal of this project was to create a basic arithmetic calculator using javascript, HTML, and CSS learned to date. This project was the first one where I experienced how a seemingly simple goal could require many different features and a necessity to frequently update existing features as unforeseen scenarios came along. View the <a href='https://michaeljchong.github.io/calculator/'>final product</a>.</p>

<h2>Lesson's learned:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep a running pseudocode/outline of the project and how different elements should interact with each other</li>
    <li>Keep a running list of base test cases that the code should be able to pass. Update this list to include more extensive tests as new features get added.</li>
    <li>Split up the project into features and focus on implementing one feature completely before moving on to the next.</li>
    <li>Use git branches when adding a new feature to preserve the completed code in the main branch</li>
    <li>Take a break when stuck and come back to approach the problem from a different angle</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript used:</h2>
<ul>
